The screenshots are what we have in the database so far. I will need
some informations for what yall want to store into it because I'm noob
at footballs' stuff and betting :( However, I can show you how to work
on the database. So. I'm using AWS as host and MySQL workbench on Window 11 
for the database. You can download the MySQL workbench here:
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
After installing, select the + next to MySQL Connections and fill in:
Connection name: up to you
Host name: betsmart.c4vgirc2flsl.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
Username: admin
Password -> store in vault -> password: Password1
Test Connection -> If it's good -> OK
Feel free to ask me anything
Nhat
