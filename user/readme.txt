So... I'm working on having a database with AWS. However, this is the codes using 
eecs's mysql database host for users' logging in and signing up. I'll update the 
connections to our project's "official" database in spring 3. This is the link to
the log in and sign in page using these codes: 
https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~m926n810/BetSmart
this is the link to the page that fetches whatever from the Users table in the database:
